   * Grow your own Bamboo tree to get started. This is found in the Cultivator and planted using an Ancient Seed - tree growth is about 1000-1200 seconds.

   * Chop down your Bamboo trees to gather materials, craft your Bamboo Building tool on the WorkBench, and use it to build your bamboozle pieces.

   * Bamboo Walls, Stairs, Roofs, Gates, Doors, Fences and even "Wild Bamboo Walls" that are sets of bamboo trees to build like perimeter walls!

   * Compatibility with PlantEverything - Bamboozled even has server sync config so you can control crafting cost if put on your server!
   
   * The Totem controls the placement of bamboo walls and other building piece, much like a workbench, this radius is increased slightly larger then default workbenches.

   * Works with ComfyGizmoï»¿ or add OP_Bamboo_Sapling to a SpawnThat config.
